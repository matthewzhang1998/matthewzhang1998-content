I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, co-advised by [Prof. Murat Erdogdu](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~erdogdu/) and [Prof. Animesh Garg](https://animesh.garg.tech/). I am also affiliated with the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).

I am interested in machine learning and applied statistics. In particular, I am interested in complexity theory as applied to techniques in sampling and optimization, and machine learning more broadly.

Previously I was a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Toronto. Before that, I was an undergraduate student in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. During my undergraduate I performed research at the University of Toronto, advised by [Prof. Jimmy Ba](https://jimmylba.github.io/) and [Prof. Bradly Stadie](https://bstadie.github.io/). My undergraduate thesis was supervised by [Prof. Roger Grosse](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/).
