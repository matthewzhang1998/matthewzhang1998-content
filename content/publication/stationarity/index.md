abstract: For the task of sampling from a density π∝exp(−V) on R^d, where V is possibly non-convex but L-gradient Lipschitz, we prove that averaged Langevin Monte Carlo outputs a sample with ε-relative Fisher information after O(L^2d^2/ε^2) iterations. This is the sampling analogue of complexity bounds for finding an ε-approximate first-order stationary points in non-convex optimization and therefore constitutes a first step towards the general theory of non-log-concave sampling. We discuss numerous extensions and applications of our result; in particular, it yields a new state-of-the-art guarantee for sampling from distributions which satisfy a Poincaré inequality.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: 'We provide an upper bound for the relative Fisher information after some number of iterations of LMC. This is the first known sampling analogue of complexity bounds for finding approximate first-order stationary points in non-convex optimization.'
